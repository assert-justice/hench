## The Gig Economy Satire Nobody Needs
This is an interactive fiction project inspired by the podcast [Kill James Bond](https://killjamesbondpod.podbean.com/).

It's still very much under construction but the idea is that this can host short, silly, madlibs style stories contributed by users.

It is also a React example for my students and other people unfortunate enough to be learning web development and React specifically.
